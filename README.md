# Hi there, I'm Philipp ðŸ‘‹
I am a student at [42Heilbronn](https://www.42heilbronn.de/en/) where I (amongst many other things) learn about programming (mainly in C and C++) and UNIX system administration.

So far I gathered experience with the following languages and technologies:\

# Some of my Projects
## [miniRT](https://github.com/pweinstock/miniRT) [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=c)](https://skillicons.dev)
My fellow 42 student [shackbei](https://github.com/shackbei) and I built a raytracing-based 3D renderer in C. Using a path tracing algorithm, we were able to implement fundamental physical and mathematical concepts to generate images.
## [minishell](https://github.com/pweinstock/minishell) [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=c,bash)](https://skillicons.dev)
[khirsig](https://github.com/khirsig) and I coded a small bash-like shell in C. Its features include several builtins, redirections, pipes, subshells, variables, and much more.
## [webserv](https://github.com/pweinstock/webserv) [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cpp,nginx,html)](https://skillicons.dev)
Together with my peers [yavuzsonmez](https://github.com/yavuzsonmez) and [joluc](https://github.com/joluc), I created a HTTP web server in C++. We used Nginx as a reference, and our server is following the HTTP/1.1 standard. In this project, I learned a lot about the HTTP protocol, multithreading vs multiplexing and the use of sockets.
## [ft_transcendence](https://github.com/pweinstock/ft_transcendence) [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=docker,ts,nestjs,react,materialui,postgres)](https://skillicons.dev)
[doreshev](https://github.com/doreshev), [tomah56](https://github.com/tomah56) and me created a fully functional website with frontend, backend and database.
Users will need to run through an authentication process, login and can then play our reinterpretation of the game [Pong (1972)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) agains each other, spectate an ongoing game, chat with other users or browse through user profiles and the highscore board.
